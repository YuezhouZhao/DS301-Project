# CLIP Art Style Classification

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify different styles of art and generate a text description for each piece. We will utilize and fine-tune the CLIP model, which connects texts and images and can be applied to any visual classification task.

## Problem Motivation
- Complex Visual Features: Traditional models struggle with complex art visual features.
- Lack of Text-Image Integration: CNN models can't handle image and text together, limiting semantic understanding.
- Limited Information Extraction: Image-based classification overlooks valuable text information, hindering research and museum experiences.

## Project Milestones
1. Data Preprocessing (Image Preprocessing & Text Preprocessing)
2. Train and Evaluate Baseline CNN Model
3. Fine-tune the Pretrained CLIP Model
4. Hyperparameter Tuning the CLIP Model

## Background Work
We will use the following dataset for this project:
- [European artworks dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ansonnnnn/historic-art) from the Web Gallery of Art.
- Images of European artwork.
- CSV artwork dataset detailing art background, such as title, time period, and texture.
- CSV info dataset detailing image information, such as artist and nationality.
